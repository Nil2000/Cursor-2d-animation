## Final Plan for production

1. **Database**: Use [NeonDB](https://www.neon.db/) as database. NeonDB is a cloud-native, open-source, and fully managed database service.

2. **Queue**: Use [Redis](https://redis.io/) for queue. Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

3. **Object Storage**: Use [Cloudflare R2](https://r2.cloudflarestorage.com/) for Object Storage. Cloudflare R2 is a fast and reliable object storage service, built by Cloudflare.

4. **Main App**: Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for main app. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with Next.js.

5. **Processor and Redis**: Use [DigitalOcean VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vps/) for processor and redis. DigitalOcean provides highly available, secure, and scalable virtual servers in the cloud.
